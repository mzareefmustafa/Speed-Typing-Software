# 🐱 Typing Speed Test with Auto-Correct

## 🚀 Features  

- **Typing Speed & Accuracy** – Tracks WPM and correctness in real time.  
- **Auto-Correct** – Fixes common typos using smart algorithms.  
- **Multiplayer Mode** – Race against others and see who types fastest!  
- **Detailed Stats** – See per-word speed, mistakes, and improvements.  
- **Custom Topics** – Practice typing on subjects you actually care about.
